# silentcatfarts-shared-assets
Personal Foundry VTT module for use with shadowdark, dnd5e and ose.
Creates game specific compendiums for assets that I don't feel like recreating from scratch for new worlds.
Requires images and sound files in the /foundryuserdata/Data/age-shared folder path.
That data is not provided due to licensing issues.
